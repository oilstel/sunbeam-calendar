        <p>If I had to choose something to worship I'd pray to the sun.</p>
    
        <h2>clouds and sun</h2>
    
        <p>Been thinking about clouds and sunbeams. A friend told me the sun is a natural disinfectant. I'll try to sit in a sunbeam for 10 minutes daily.</p>
    
        <h2>cooking</h2>

        <h2>notes</h2>
    
        <p>I made a website today but the internet feels a bit overwhelmed at the moment. I think I'll take a break from social media soon and just post when I update this page.</p>
